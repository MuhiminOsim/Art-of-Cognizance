It's Md. Muhiminul Islam who did his B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology. I have recently joined Kite Games Studio as Jr. Software Engineer.

I really love solving competitive programming problems and playing with data structures and algorithms. I participated in a lot of online contests and in some onsite contests as well and have some remarkable achievements too. I also served as a problem setter and judge in some contests.

I am the former president of SGIPC which is a university club for competitive programmers. I really loved leading those people to arrange workshops, contests and events to improve problem solving skills.

Moreover, I love philosophy. Observations on lives and the mystery of the life is the thing that I am really interested in. This blog is not only about competitive programming and other CS fundamentals, but also about the cognizance of life. Some fragrance about philosophy may also be found.
